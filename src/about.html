          I'm a programmer and classical singer based in the greater Chicago
          area. I love the web and web standards. Building with plain old HTML,
          CSS and JS is underrated. I think DSLs are underrated in general.
          React is fine but I'd rather use Svelte. I like using Typescript until
          I have to do something complicated. I like using Tailwind until I have
          to do something complicated. I try to learn about as many tools as
          possible and then pick the right tool for the job. When I'm not
          programming, I like to sing in vocal ensembles around Chicago and
          beyond. In 2023, I won a GRAMMY award as a soloist on Born, released
          by The Crossing, singing the music of Edie Hill. In the summers, I
          sing in the Grant Park Chorus, part of the Grant Park Music Festival
          which is one of Chicago's best kept secrets. My wife and I enjoy
          building websites and apps together, entertaining, and raising our
          Australian Shepherd puppy.
